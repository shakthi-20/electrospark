  The provided code has specific requirements for the versions of the libraries it uses. Here's a brief explanation of each requirement:



These requirements ensure that the code can run efficiently and take advantage of the latest features and optimizations provided by these libraries.






 Our Smart Farming Hackathon project integrates cutting-edge technology to revolutionize agriculture. Utilizing Arduino, Python, the Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit, and the Intel® Math Kernel Library (Intel® MKL), we have developed a system that monitors essential parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels in real-time.

Through Arduino, we gather data from sensors placed in the field, while Python, with the assistance of NumPy, Pandas, and the Intel® MKL, processes this data to reveal valuable insights. The Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit enhances our data analysis capabilities, enabling us to predict optimal planting times and detect diseases early.
 The Intel® oneAPI Toolkit further boosts our project's performance, ensuring efficient data processing and analysis.The generated output provides farmers with valuable insights into various parameters affecting their crops, such as soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels.Our plant health prediction solution is significantly enhanced with the integration of Intel® Math Kernel Library (MKL), which optimizes mathematical operations in our neural network model. MKL ensures that computations are performed efficiently, leading to faster inference times and improved overall performance.

Without MKL, our solution would still function, but the computational efficiency and speed would be reduced. The neural network model would take longer to process sensor data and make predictions, potentially impacting the real-time nature of the application.
By leveraging MKL, we can provide farmers with a faster and more responsive plant health prediction system, ultimately helping them make timely decisions to improve crop yield and sustainability.

For our smart farming project, we have decided to utilize three key sensors: the Nutrient Soil Sensor, Soil Moisture Sensor, and Temperature Sensor. These sensors play a crucial role in monitoring the vital parameters of the soil and environment necessary for plant growth.

In the future, we plan to expand our sensor array to include additional sensors for more comprehensive data collection. This expansion will enable us to gather a broader range of environmental data, allowing for more detailed analysis and better decision-making.

All these sensors are connected to an Arduino Uno board, which serves as the central hub for data collection and processing. The Arduino Uno board collects sensor data and sends it to our AI models for analysis and prediction.

Due to the unavailability of hardware, we have decided to use datasheets and sample input values to simulate sensor readings. This approach allows us to test and develop our AI models without the need for physical sensors.

The following is an example of how we can generate input values for our AI models using sample data:

# Sample input values for soil sensors (nutrient soil sensor, soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor)
sample_input = [3.5, 45, 25]  # Nutrient level, Soil moisture (%), Temperature (°C)

These sample input values represent typical sensor readings that our AI models would process to make predictions and provide recommendations for optimal plant health and resource allocation.









Training Machine Learning Models for Plant Health Prediction

The machine learning models used in our solution are trained using a combination of neural networks, decision trees, and ensemble methods like random forests. Here's a detailed overview of how each type of model is trained:

1. **Neural Networks:**
   - **Data Preparation:** The sensor data collected from the field is preprocessed and divided into features (input variables) and labels (output variables).
   - **Model Architecture:** We define a neural network architecture suitable for our classification task. This typically includes an input layer matching the number of features, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer with two units for binary classification (healthy or unhealthy plant).
   - **Loss Function and Optimizer:** We use the cross-entropy loss function, which is commonly used for classification tasks. The Adam optimizer is used to optimize the network weights during training.
   - **Training:** The neural network is trained using the preprocessed data. We iterate over the dataset multiple times (epochs), adjusting the weights of the network to minimize the loss function.
   
2. **Decision Trees:**
   - **Data Preparation:** Similar to neural networks, the data is prepared by splitting it into features and labels.
   - **Model Training:** Decision trees are trained by recursively splitting the data based on the features to create a tree structure. The splits are made to minimize a specific criterion, such as Gini impurity or entropy.
   - **Tree Pruning (Optional):** After training, the decision tree may be pruned to reduce overfitting and improve generalization to new data.

3. **Ensemble Learning (Random Forests):**
   - **Data Preparation:** The data is prepared as before, with features and labels.
   - **Model Training:** Random forests are trained by constructing multiple decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data and features. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all trees (voting or averaging).
   - **Ensemble Benefits:** By combining multiple decision trees, random forests reduce overfitting and improve the overall prediction accuracy.

Throughout the training process, we monitor the model's performance on a separate validation dataset to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data. Once trained, the models can be used to predict plant health based on new sensor data, providing valuable insights for farmers to optimize their crop management practices.

A PlantHealthPredictor class designed to predict the health status of plants based on various sensor values. Here's a detailed explanation of how the code works:

  * Importing Libraries: The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, torch, and sklearn.

 * Setting MKL Threads: The code sets the number of threads to be used by MKL for parallel execution, which can enhance performance.

 * PlantHealthPredictor Class: This class contains several methods for loading data, training the model, making predictions, providing feedback, and recommending optimal resource allocation.

 * __init__: Initializes the class with a None model.

* load_data_from_file: Loads data from a CSV file, separating features (X) and labels (y).

* train_model: Trains a neural network model using the features (X) and labels (y) data. It uses a sequential neural network with two linear layers and a ReLU activation function.

* predict: Predicts the health status of a plant based on a new sample.

* feedback: Provides feedback based on the prediction, indicating whether the plant is healthy or needs attention for optimal growth.

* optimal_resource_allocation: Recommends optimal actions based on the sensor values to improve the plant's health. Actions include adjusting soil moisture, temperature, nutrient levels, pH, pest control, oxygen levels, manure, and weed presence.

* save_model and load_model: Save and load the trained model to/from a file.

* Main Execution: The main section of the code creates an instance of the PlantHealthPredictor class, loads data from a file, trains the model, selects a random sample for prediction, predicts the plant health, provides feedback, and recommends optimal resource allocation based on the sensor values.

 * Output: The output of the code includes the prediction (healthy or unhealthy), the sensor values used for prediction, and the recommended actions for optimal resource allocation.

Overall, this demonstrates how machine learning and AI algorithms can be used in smart farming to predict plant health and provide actionable recommendations for improving crop yield and health. The use of libraries like torch for neural network training and sklearn for data manipulation and model evaluation enhances the code's capabilities and efficiency.





DATA NORMALIZATION:

 we have used Min-Max scaling for data normalization. Min-Max scaling scales the data to a fixed range, usually between 0 and 1. Here's how we have applied data normalization using Min-Max scaling in the load_data_from_file method. we first load the data from the CSV file and then use MinMaxScaler from sklearn.preprocessing to normalize the input features (X). The fit_transform method of MinMaxScaler calculates the minimum and maximum values of each feature and scales the features to a specified range (by default, 0 to 1). The normalized features (X_normalized) are then returned along with the labels (y).

By normalizing the input features, we ensure that each feature contributes equally to the model's learning process, which can improve the performance of machine learning algorithms, especially neural networks.

Drones equipped with high-resolution cameras and AI algorithms can quickly scan large areas of farmland, identifying areas that require immediate attention. This will enable farmers to take timely actions, such as pest control or irrigation, improving overall efficiency.

4. **Blockchain for Traceability and Transparency**: Introducing blockchain technology for traceability and transparency in the supply chain will add value to our smart farming project. By recording each stage of production and distribution on a blockchain, consumers can trace the journey of their food products, ensuring authenticity and quality.
